      <p>The difference between cooking and baking is that one is kind of an art, and the other is chemistry. Cooking is also chemistry, but is much more forgiving.

If you add too much yeast, you're going to have a bad time.</p>

      <p>If you forgot to add vanilla to your chocolate chip cookies, and then you add vanilla afterward, your cookies are gonna be gross.</p>
      <p>If you forget tags, the browser might add its own tags. In addition, the tags it adds may be void of flavor and cause issues later on.</p>
